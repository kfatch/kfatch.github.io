  <h1>How It's Made</h1>
  <p>Every shirt is made with using two main components. The first is how we get the designs. A Direct-To-Film, or DTF for short, printer is used to print the designs directly onto a film.
    This film is then used with the second component to apply the design to the shirts. The second piece of equipment is something called a Heat Press.
