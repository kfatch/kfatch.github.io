  <p>Every shirt is made using a DTF Printer and a Heat Press. The first machine in the process is called a DTF printer. A DTF, or Direct-To-Film, printer is used to print the designs directly onto a heat transferable film.
     This film is then used with the second component to apply the design to the shirts.

  <p>The second piece of equipment is something called a Heat Press. You put the shirt with and the design in between the two plates on the press. You align the design where you want it to be on the shirt.
    Finally, you close the two plates of the heat press to apply pressure while simultaneously applying heat. Once enough time has passed, you remove the shirt from the press and remove the excess film.
    After cooling, the design has been binded to the shirt.
